---Introduction---
Auto Clicker is a simple program that simulates mouse clicks.
Just set the speed of the mouse clicks in 1000's of a second and click the start button.
So for one click every second set it to 1000 or for 2 clicks a second set it to 500 etc.
200 is a good value to simulate a constant double click speed.
You can stop the auto clicking by moving the mouse over the stop button.

PLEASE BE CAREFUL when running this program,
it can be dangerous having a wild clicking mouse moving around your desktop!
